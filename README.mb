ðŸ“ˆ LSTM Nuclear Stock Prediction Model
ðŸš€ Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to predict nuclear-related stock prices.
It leverages historical stock market data, processes it with time-series techniques, and trains an LSTM network to forecast future price trends.

ðŸ›  Features
    - Data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling, splitting into train/test sets).
    - Sequential modeling with Keras/TensorFlow.
    - LSTM layers optimized for time-series forecasting.
    - Visualization of predictions vs actual stock values.
    - Customizable for different stock tickers or time windows.
